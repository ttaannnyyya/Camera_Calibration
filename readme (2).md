Steps to Execute
1. Open Google Colab
Go to Google Colab.
Create a new notebook by clicking on New Notebook.
2. Copy and Paste the Code
Copy the camera calibration code from the provided script and paste it into a code cell in your Colab notebook.
3. Download the Image
The image used in the calibration process is retrieved directly from an open-source URL.
The code automatically downloads the image file (a checkerboard pattern) from the URL specified in the script.
4. Run the Code
Execute the code cell to:
Download the image.
Perform chessboard corner detection in the image.
Calculate and display intrinsic parameters (camera matrix and distortion coefficients).
Calculate and display extrinsic parameters (rotation matrix and translation vector) for each image.
5. Understanding the Output
Intrinsic Matrix (K): Represents the camera's internal parameters such as focal length and optical center.
Distortion Coefficients: These help in correcting the lens distortion in images.
Rotation Matrices: Represent the orientation of the camera in world coordinates.
Translation Vectors: Represent the camera's position in the world.
Code Explanation
Step 1: Image Download: The image is retrieved from an open-source URL using urllib.
Step 2: Chessboard Pattern: A 9x6 checkerboard is used for calibration. The 3D object points (coordinates of the checkerboard corners) are generated based on the known size of the squares.
Step 3: Detecting Corners: The corners of the checkerboard are detected using OpenCV's findChessboardCorners() function.
Step 4: Camera Calibration: The calibrateCamera() function calculates the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from the 3D-2D point correspondences.
Step 5: Displaying Parameters: The intrinsic matrix, distortion coefficients, rotation matrices, and translation vectors are printed out to the console.
